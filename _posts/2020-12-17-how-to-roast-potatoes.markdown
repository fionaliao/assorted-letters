With Christmas coming up, I thought I should write something festive. So today I'll be showing you how to make an integral part of Christmas dinner: roast potatoes. 

There are many ways to roast potatoes. I've given a few options below:

* Pomme de terre? More like pomme de terrible. 

* No one's ever said "you look like a potato" as a compliment.

* At least my gas doesn't [literally kill people](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/horrific-tales-of-potatoes-that-caused-mass-sickness-and-even-death-3162870/). 

* When you describe someone as hot, it's usually a good thing. But nobody wants a hot potato.

* You can't spell potato without "poo". 

* They say that “eyes are the windows to the soul”. I'd say that's accurate considering your eyes are poisonous and should be avoided. 

* Yukon Gold? More like you can go away. 

* I'm not *saying* you have a terrible personality, but we literally had to find another species before we could describe potatoes as "sweet".

I hope I've helped make your Christmas dinner a success. Let me know how you found the recipe. :)
