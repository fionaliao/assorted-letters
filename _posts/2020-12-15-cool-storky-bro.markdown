![Bird dipping its beak into water](/assorted-letters/assets/2020-12-15-cool-storky-bro.jpg)

With each dip of my beak, the water ripples outwards, circles stretching out into infinity. I pause for a moment to appreciate my gift for words before launching into my next insightful comment. The butterfly effect says the simple act of a butterfly fluttering its wings could cause a tornado on the other side of the world. I wonder what outsized impact creating ripples in the lake could lead to. Maybe world peace or something cool like that. Or maybe someone will take a picture of the ripples and post it on Instagram and pretend to write in the POV of a bird and then copy the Instagram post to their writing blog because they think they've written something funny.

*Is this actually a stork? I hope it is for the sake of the post title. I'm just winging it right now. I hope the potential misidentification hasn't ruffled any feathers.* 

*Fun fact: Instagram makes it hard to download a picture. Right-clicking on the image doesn't bring up a "Save Image As..." option. I had to use my hacker skillz to open up the Firefox developer console to find the relevant request for the image URL.*
