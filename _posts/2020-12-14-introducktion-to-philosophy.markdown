I ponder questions so complex they're deeper than the river I'm thoughtfully staring into. What is the meaning of life? Is war ever just? What should form the basis of my morality? Why am I being anthropomorphised I don't care for philosophising I'm just a duck so feed me or I'll poop on your boat. Quack.

*I'm currently doing the [Introduction to Philosophy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy) course on Coursera, which means I am now qualified to confidently misuse philosophical terms in conversations. In all seriousness, I think it's a nice gentle entry into the subject and I'm enjoying it.*
