![Duck looking into a river](/assorted-letters/assets/2020-12-14-introducktion-to-philosophy.jpg)

I ponder questions so complex they’re deeper than the river I’m thoughtfully staring into.

What is the meaning of life? 

Is war ever just? 

What should form the basis of my morality? 

Why am I being anthropomorphised? I'm a duck. Just feed me or I'll poop on your boat. 

Quack.
