Have you ever had an issue where the apples you order for your grocery delivery have been unavailable so they’re swapped out for alternatives and the replacement apples you get are bigger and better quality and more expensive but you get them cheap because they aren’t your original choice and it sounds great at first but then you start eating the apples which turns out to be An Ordeal because these apples are double the size of the ones you're used to and take so much more time and effort to eat and you can’t have half an apple and save the rest for later because that just feels weird but you don’t want to throw away an half-eaten apple either because that’s a waste so you just end up avoiding eating apples altogether to sidestep the problem. 

No? Um, neither have I.
